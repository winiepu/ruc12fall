  <div class="entry_content"><p><em>Course Description</em>:</p>

<p>This course is required for all undergraduate majors and for most minors in economics. It is also a
prerequisite for many other undergraduate economics courses. The purpose of this course is to
provide a formal exposition of modern macroeconomics. I will start building up from what you have
learned before and expand it; yet, the analysis will be done in a rigorous way. For this reason, the
tools you’ve learned in Intermediate Micro will prove extremely useful (I will do a small review
before using them); even though this is not a microeconomics course, you need to be sure why things
happen and to keep a clear idea of what’s going on behind all the results we get. In the end, both
graphical and mathematical analysis will be used for the exposition.  Up to now, there is no
“definite” approach to teaching an intermediate macroeconomics course. While you should be
familiar with the Keynesian model, I’ll present both the Keynesian and the Real Business Cycle
(RBC) frameworks in the course, with an emphasis on the latter. The reason is simply that the RBC
model is the workhorse of modern macroeconomics (at the research frontier).  Last, but not least, an
added goal of the course is to test important theoretical results on realworld data and examples. I
think that any Macroeconomics course should balance a strong theoretical background and empirical
analysis. Get ready to crunch some data.</p>

<p><em>Prerequisite</em>:</p>

<p>I will be constantly using results you learned in Intermediate Micro, such as the utility
maximization problem and its related topics (i.e., income and substitution effects, intertemporal
choice, labor supply, etc.). Math-wise, I will take as granted that you know how to work with
calculus (derivatives and general optimization); although the course will not be math-based, I will
be using calculus from time to time when this procedure is useful to formalize the intuition. I will
try to put emphasis on the conceptual content rather than mathematical sophistication, although the
latter is sometimes unavoidable. I will provide a handout with the basics of mathematical analysis
you need to know for the course.</p>

<p>Since you will be working with data, I will assume that you have a working knowledge of programs
that help you to organize and graph numbers, such as Microsoft Excel. From past experience knowledge
of data-handling programs like MS Excel is useful well beyond the scope of this class.</p>

<p><em>Text Books</em>:</p>

<p>Up to a few years, the traditional way of teaching intermediate macro had an emphasis on Keynesian
analysis and the IS-LM framework. Nowadays we have excellent textbooks that use the modern approach
to macroeconomics, which is based on solid microeconomic foundations in a general equilibrium
environment.</p>

<p>The book we will be using is Macroeconomics, by Stephen Williamson (3rd edition), Addison
Wesley. This textbook is required (we will be covering most of it) and should be available at online
bookstores. You are free to use the previous edition of Williamson&#8217;s book, although there may be
some minor problems with chapter numberings.</p>

<p>Although we will be following Williamson closely, you might want to review some other sources to
strengthen your understanding of the material. These (non-required) books are:</p>

<p>Macroeconomics, by N. Gregory Mankiw (6thth edition), Worth Publishers. This is a great book to strengthen your understanding of the Keynesian approach to macroeconomics.</p>

<p>Macroeconomics: A modern approach, by Robert Barro (1stst edition), Thomson South-Western. This book is somewhat similar to Williamson’s text, with an emphasis on microfoundations.</p>

<p><em>Course Requirements</em>:</p>

<p>There will be 4 homework assignments, 2 midterms and a final. Class attendance is not mandatory but is highly recommended. From past experience, students who did not attend classes on average did poorly in this class.</p>

<p><em>Exams</em>:</p>

<p>There will be two midterm exams and one final exam. The second midterm is cumulative in the sense
that the material covered builds upon heavily in the material from the first midterm. The final exam
is also cumulative, and covers all the material in the course.</p>

<p>There will be no make-up exam for the midterm (if there is a documented family or medical emergency,
the weight of the midterm will be shifted to the final).</p>

<p><em>Tentative Course Online (Preliminary, Subject to Change)</em></p>

<p>The material that will be covered is summarized below. For sure I will cover parts I through V; the
material in Part VI is optional and will be covered as a function of the remaining time and your
interest in the topics. The reference for each topic in parts I through V is in parenthesis; some
handouts will be given as a complement to the exposition in the book. I will provide additional
references for some of the topics in Part VI as needed.</p>
